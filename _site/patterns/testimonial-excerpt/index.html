  <h1>Pattern Sample: testimonial-excerpt.html</h1>

<h4>Shortcode</h4>
<p>Use the shortcode to display the testimonial and add the .excerpt class in the style section.</p>
<p>An excerpt testimonial will float on the right hand side in a content module when the viewport is wide enough. For this to work you'll need to put the shortcode in front of the content you want to float on the left.</p>
<pre><code>[testimonial id="" style="excerpt"] The text you want to float on the left of the testimonial follows the shortcode.</code></pre>
<blockquote class="testimonial testimonial__excerpt">
  <img src="images/testimonial-author.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Billy Jones" />
  <p>Working with Cronofy to provide our customers with two-way calendar sync was really efficient. The API is consistent and well documented and the support is first class. They even added a feature to fit our needs!</p>

</blockquote><!-- .content__testimonial -->
<p>The text you want to float on the left of the testimonial follows after the shortcode in the markup. When viewports are wide enough the testimonial will sit on the right and the text on the left. When viewports are too narrow for two columns, the testimonial will come first because it sits first in the source order.</p>
<blockquote class="testimonial testimonial__excerpt">
  <img src="images/testimonial-author.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Billy Jones" />
  <p>One line.</p>
